# Mastermind

> This is the project I've created for my programming exam of the IT security course at the **"La Statale" University of Milan**.
> It has only been tested on linux (fedora and ubuntu), on windows I'm not sure Unicode characters appear on the command prompt or on powershell. There are no problems using Git Bash and following [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48402025/unicode-output-java-windows-cmd) procedure on Stack Overflow.

# The game

There are two game modes: Human vs AI and AI vs Human. In the first one the game generates a random code
and there are 10 attempts to guess. In the second mode the user chooses a code and the AI guesses it
using the Knuth Five guess algorithm ([Wikipedia explanation](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)#Five-guess_algorithm>))

# How to play

The game is written in Java you must install it on your PC.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/franco-marino/mastermind.git
cd mastermind/Mastermind/dist
java -jar Mastermind.jar
```

#### And then play it!
